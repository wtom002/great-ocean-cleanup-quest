        Our web application focuses on individuals who want to change and spice up their workout
        routines. Many individuals who work out always have the problem of wanting to do something
        different whether it is to switch up their routine, type of workout, or even just want to
        try someone else’s.

        There has been a rise of fitness content online where we see fitness gurus share their own
        routines for others to try out. This article by Colin Matson talks about how algorithms are
        ruining fitness in terms of how content creators are creating scroll-stopping content to
        catch the users eye to make money
        <a href="https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/how-the-algorithm-is-ruining-fitness-and-why-it-matters-to-you-c8fdaf850a38">(Matson).</a>
        Another article talks about how Instagram influencers can try to create misinformation about workouts for clicks <a href="https://www.snapfitness.com/us/blog/the-dark-side-of-social-media-fitness-culture/">(Snap Fitness)</a>
        Our website will alleviate this problem as users will be able to search for whatever they
        want or interested in. They won’t be tricked into scroll-stopping content as nothing is
        being fed to them through an algorithm but rather search-based results the user is interested
        in. Our application focuses on users sharing and interacting with others for new fitness
        routines and tips.

        One attempt towards this problem from most social media platforms is to deliver personalized
        algorithms feeding fitness content to users. However, not all of their algorithms will feed
        just fitness content as there could be other interests from the users that deliver other content.
        Our web application will serve as one location for fitness content where users can actually
        search for specific targeted workouts instead of having something recommended to them.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p>
      When developing a web application, it is important to consider who will be using the app and
      its functionality. The users of our application will be individuals who are passionate about
      fitness and looking to expand their collection of exercises and routines as well as sharing
      what they know to others who share similar interests. These users will be accessing the app
      when they are searching for new workouts that they want to add to their daily routines and see
      if others in the fitness space have valuable tips or tricks that they might not have thought
      of before. With other applications, it can be hard to find exactly what you are looking for as
      you have to push through unwanted clutter and content that doesn’t relate to certain workouts
      they are looking for. The application will be a hub for fitness enthusiasts to share what they
      know as well as learn from others that share a similar passion for fitness.

      In terms of application functionality, we are targeting three different areas of interaction
      that we want to offer to our users. The first functionality that we want is the ability for
      users to publish their workouts to the site for the rest of the users to potentially find in
      their search. The user will be able to do things like add a title for the workout, text that
      talks about technique, number of sets and reps, and any other information that they find
      fitting as well as adding tags that will allow users to find the post based off of the
      keywords used. The second main functionality that we will add to our website is the ability to
      show the user organized and filtered results that correspond with the tags and keywords that
      they are targeting in their search. This is a functionality that contains a lot of back-end
      work in terms of figuring out what content to show by organizing and reorganizing the different
      routines that the user may potentially see. This organization of search results will create
      the best possible experience for the user by showing them only relevant and accurate
      information relative to their search query. The last functionality which is less major is
      providing the ability for users to search and filter their results to their liking which will
      greatly improve the quality of results at their disposal. When searching for workouts,
      they will be able to select tags (“Squat”, “Cable”, “Bicep”), number of reps/intensity,
      and other special requests that will be taken into account by our back-end organization system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The users will be viewing information from user data as they can upload and share their
      different workout routines. User’s post  will have specific tags to what type of routine they
      are so users can view this information which is already categorized. This app will help to
      solve our problem by creating a platform for users to come to for new fitness routines and
      tips. Instead of being fed an algorithm of content, users can directly search for the
      information they want to receive. This will help to create an environment where they feel that
      they can find what they are looking for and be apart of a community that is helpful and
      supportive of each other which is often lacking on other platforms.
