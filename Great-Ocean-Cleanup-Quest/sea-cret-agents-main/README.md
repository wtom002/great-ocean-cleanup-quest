# The Great Ocean Cleanup Quest

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem Summary

The state of our oceans has been significantly impacted by climate change and human activities, and this has had a profound effect on the diverse range of habitats and species that reside within them. Given the severity of this issue, it is crucial that we pay close attention to the situation. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to fully comprehend the extent of the damage and to locate reliable resources that offer guidance on how we can help to mitigate it. As a solution, an engaging and entertaining RPG (Role-playing game) could be an effective means of raising awareness and encouraging positive action. A role-playing game is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
